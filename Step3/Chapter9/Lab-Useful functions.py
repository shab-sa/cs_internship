# Looking back at the labs in chapters 6 and 7 , refactor that code into functions for
# cleaning and processing the data. The goal should be that most of the logic is moved
# into functions. Use your own judgment as to the types of functions and parameters, but
# keep in mind that functions should do just one thing, and they shouldnâ€™t have any side
# effects that carry over outside the function.
