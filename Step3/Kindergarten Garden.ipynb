    "\n",
    "They've chosen to grow grass, clover, radishes, and violets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, the children have put little cups along the window sills, and\n",

    "## Python Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests for this exercise expect your program to be implemented as a Garden `class` in Python.\n",
    "If you are unfamiliar with classes in Python, [classes][classes in python] from the Python docs is a good place to start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your `class` should implement a `method` called plants, which takes a student's name as an argument and returns the `list` of plant names belonging to that student.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructors\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the example garden\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[window][window][window]\n",
    "VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV\n",
    "VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "would, in the tests, be represented as `Garden(\"VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV\\nVRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this representation work, your `class` will need to implement an `__init__()` method.\n",
    "If you're not familiar with `__init__()` or _constructors_, [class and instance objects][class vs instance objects in python] from the Python docs gives a more detailed explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Default Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "In some tests, a `list` of students is passed as an argument to `__init__()`.\n",
    "This should override the twelve student roster provided in the problem statement.\n",
    "Both of these statements need to work with your `__init__()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Make a garden based on the default 12-student roster.\n",
    "Garden(\"VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV\\nVRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV\") \n",
    "\n",
    "# Make a garden based on a 2-student roster.\n",
    "Garden(\"VRCC\\nVCGG\", students=[\"Valorie\", \"Raven\"]) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to make the student `list` a [default argument][default argument values]; the Python docs describe `default parameters` in depth while explaining [function definitions][function definitions].\n",
